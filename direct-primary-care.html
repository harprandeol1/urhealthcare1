  <!-- Direct Primary Care Overview -->

      <h2>What is Direct Primary Care?</h2>
      <p>Direct Primary Care (DPC) is a modern, patient-centered approach to healthcare that removes the middlemen—insurance companies, networks, and third-party approvals—so you can focus on your health with your doctor. Instead of paying for each visit or service, patients join through a simple <strong>monthly membership</strong> that covers unlimited access to primary and urgent care.</p>

      <h3>Our Membership Pricing</h3>
      <ul class="list-clean">
        <li><strong>Individual:</strong> $79/month – Unlimited primary & urgent care, same/next-day access, and virtual visits.</li>
        <li><strong>Spouse:</strong> $50/month – Add your partner with full membership benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Child (5+):</strong> $30/month – Pediatric sick & well visits with rapid access for families.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">Specialty and hospital services are outside the DPC fee. Many members pair DPC with a high-deductible or catastrophic insurance plan for broader coverage.</p>

      <h3>What’s Included at urHealthcare</h3>
      <ul class="list-clean">
        <li><strong>Continuity Primary Care</strong> – Preventive, chronic, and acute care with the provider you choose.</li>
        <li><strong>7-Day Urgent Care</strong> – Walk-in or virtual care for common illnesses and injuries.</li>
        <li><strong>250+ Included Medications</strong> – <a href="included-meds.html">See covered list</a>, provided at no extra cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Labs</strong> – Routine panels and rapid tests (<a href="labs.html">see labs</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>X-ray & Ultrasound</strong> – On-site imaging for quick diagnosis and treatment.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Why Patients Choose DPC</h3>
      <ul class="list-clean">
        <li><strong>Transparent Pricing</strong> – One flat monthly fee. No surprise bills.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Access</strong> – Shorter wait times and more time with your doctor.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Care</strong> – Direct communication via phone, text, or telehealth.</li>
        <li><strong>Whole-Person Health</strong> – Prevention, wellness, and stronger doctor-patient relationships.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why It’s Different</h3>
      <p>In traditional healthcare, insurance companies often dictate how doctors practice—limiting time with patients and inflating costs. Direct Primary Care flips that model: your membership is a direct relationship with your doctor. This means your provider works for you—not for the insurance company.</p>

      <h3>Who Benefits from DPC?</h3>
      <ul class="list-clean">
        <li><strong>Individuals & Families</strong> – Affordable, predictable healthcare costs with unlimited access.</li>
        <li><strong>Employers</strong> – Lower healthcare costs while providing better access and fewer sick days.</li>
        <li><strong>Patients with Chronic Conditions</strong> – Ongoing support without worrying about visit costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>In short:</strong> Direct Primary Care at urHealthcare is simple, affordable, and built entirely around you. It’s healthcare the way it should be—transparent, convenient, and relationship-driven.</p>
